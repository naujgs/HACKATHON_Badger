## Seller's GrandPrix

Prototype of a website. You have a list of places (customers), you choose some of then and our website show you the best route to go down the places.

You can see route information (time and distance). Partial information (bewteen customers) and total information (all the route)



On the other hand, there are two ideas.

1. Workers compete each other to do their routes as fast as posible. For this reason, below the map there are two tables (rewards and current times).

2. Workers can post on the map new posibles clients. For this there are on mark in Ensteing Square.

The only part that currently work it's the route calculator. The rest doesn't work because I had only 10 hour to develop the proyect.
